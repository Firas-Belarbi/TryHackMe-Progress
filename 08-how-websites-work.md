# How Websites Work – TryHackMe

## Overview
This room explains the core concepts behind how websites operate.  
It covers the relationship between clients and servers, the role of HTTP, how browsers request content, and how web servers respond.  
Understanding these fundamentals is essential before learning web security or web exploitation.

## Key Concepts Learned

### Client and Server Model
A **client** (browser) sends a request, and a **server** replies with the requested content.  
Typical sequence:
1. User enters a URL.  
2. Browser sends an HTTP request to the server.  
3. Server processes the request and returns a response.  
4. Browser renders the content.

### Web Servers
Web servers store and serve website files.  
Common server software:
- Apache  
- Nginx  
- IIS  

A server returns HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets.

### Website Files
A website typically contains:
- **HTML**: Structure and content  
- **CSS**: Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript**: Client-side logic  
- **Images, fonts, media**

The browser combines these elements to display a webpage.

### URLs and Routing
A URL identifies the resource being requested.  
Example:

```
https://example.com/products/index.html
```

Components:
- Protocol: https  
- Domain: example.com  
- Path: /products/index.html  

The server uses the path to locate the file or route the request.

## HTTP Review
The room reinforces the basics of HTTP:
- Request = method, path, headers, optional body  
- Response = status code, headers, body  
- Common methods: GET, POST  
- Common codes: 200, 301, 404, 500

## Static vs Dynamic Content

### Static Content
Files stored exactly as they are:
- HTML  
- Images  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### Dynamic Content
Generated by server-side logic:
- PHP  
- Python (Flask, Django)  
- Node.js  
- Databases  

Dynamic pages change based on user input or server data.

## Practical Notes Learned
- A browser never directly accesses a database; it always communicates through the server.  
- The server may communicate with other systems (APIs, DBs) before returning a response.  
- Most web vulnerabilities take advantage of incorrect handling of HTTP requests, user input, or server logic.  
- Understanding how a website is structured helps identify possible attack points.

## Relevance to Cybersecurity
This room builds necessary foundational knowledge for:
- Web exploitation  
- Burp Suite usage  
- Understanding vulnerable web applications  
- SOC analysis of web traffic  
- Detecting abnormal HTTP patterns  
- Learning SQLi, XSS, CSRF, and authentication weaknesses  

A SOC analyst must understand how normal web traffic works before analyzing malicious traffic.

## Summary
This room explained how websites function at a basic technical level.  
It covered the client-server model, website files, HTTP requests and responses, static and dynamic content, and how the browser renders web pages.  
This understanding is essential for deeper web security and later TryHackMe rooms.
