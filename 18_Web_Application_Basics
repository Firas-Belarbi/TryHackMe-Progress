## 🎯 Learning Objectives  

- Understand what a web application is and how browsers interact with it  
- Break down the components of a URL  
- Learn the structure and flow of HTTP requests and responses  
- Familiarize with HTTP methods and status codes  
- Discover important HTTP security headers

## 🔑 Key Concepts Learned  

### 1. What is a Web Application?  
A web app is software accessible via a web browser, consisting of:

- **Front End:** What users see (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- **Back End:** Servers, databases, APIs managing data and logic  
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects apps from malicious traffic

---

### 2. URL Anatomy  
URLs are the addresses used to locate resources online.

Components include:  
- **Scheme:** Protocol (http or https)  
- **User info:** Optional username/password  
- **Host:** Domain name or IP address  
- **Port:** Communication endpoint (default 80 or 443)  
- **Path:** Specific resource location  
- **Query String:** Additional parameters  
- **Fragment:** Page section anchor

### 3. HTTP Messages  

#### HTTP Requests  
Sent by client to server, consist of:  
- Start line (method, path, version)  
- Headers (Host, User-Agent, Content-Type...)  
- Optional body (for POST, PUT)

Common methods:  
- **GET:** Retrieve data  
- **POST:** Send data  
- **PUT/DELETE:** Modify/delete resources  

#### HTTP Responses  
Sent by server, consist of:  
- Status line (version, status code, reason)  
- Headers (Content-Type, Set-Cookie...)  
- Body (HTML, JSON, images...)

---

### 4. HTTP Status Codes  

Categories:  
- **1xx:** Informational  
- **2xx:** Success (e.g., 200 OK)  
- **3xx:** Redirection (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently)  
- **4xx:** Client Errors (e.g., 404 Not Found)  
- **5xx:** Server Errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)  

---

### 5. Security Headers  

Important headers to protect web apps:  
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Restricts content sources  
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Forces HTTPS connections  
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Stops MIME sniffing  
- **Referrer-Policy:** Controls information shared on navigation

## 🛠 Practical Tasks  

- Make a **GET** request to `/api/users`  
  - Flag: `THM{YOU_HAVE_JUST_FOUND_THE_USER_LIST}`  

- Make a **POST** request to `/api/user/2` to update Bob's country  
  - Flag: `THM{YOU_HAVE_MODIFIED_THE_USER_DATA}`  

- Make a **DELETE** request to `/api/user/1`  
  - Flag: `THM{YOU_HAVE_JUST_DELETED_A_USER}`  

---

## 📚 Conclusion  
You've gained a solid foundation on:  

- Web app structure and components  
- URL anatomy and HTTP communication  
- HTTP methods, status codes, and security headers  

Prepare to dive deeper into web application security next!
