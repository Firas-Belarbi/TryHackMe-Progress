# Offensive Security Intro – TryHackMe

## 🧩 Room Overview
This room is my first hands-on introduction to offensive security.  
I practiced attacking a purposely vulnerable website in a safe, legal environment to understand how ethical hackers think and operate.

- Platform: **TryHackMe**
- Path: **Introduction / Beginner**
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Focus: Basic web hacking concepts and the mindset of an attacker

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between **ethical hacking** and malicious hacking  
- Learn how attackers identify **entry points** and map the **attack surface**  
- Perform first real offensive actions against a controlled web target  
- Build an initial offensive mindset useful for both red-team and SOC roles  

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Ethical Hacking Fundamentals
- Ethical hackers always work with **permission** and follow a defined **scope**
- The goal is to discover security weaknesses *before* real attackers do  
- Reporting and documenting findings is an essential part of the job  

### 2. Attack Surface Understanding
- Websites have multiple potential entry points:  
  - Login pages  
  - Input fields  
  - URLs  
  - Hidden directories  
- A larger attack surface = more opportunities for exploitation  

### 3. Common Web Weaknesses (High-Level Overview)
The room briefly introduced examples such as:  
- Weak authentication  
- Missing input validation  
- Misconfigured services  
- Exposed admin panels  

*(Deep exploitation like SQLi, XSS, LFI, etc. comes in future rooms.)*

### 4. Attacker Mindset
- Gather information first (**reconnaissance**)  
- Test different inputs and observe behavior  
- Think “What happens if I break the rules?”  
- Be patient, methodical, and creative

## 🧪 Practical Lab Experience

I worked inside a built-in browser-based virtual machine and performed tasks like:

- Navigating and exploring a vulnerable website  
- Observing how pages respond to unusual input  
- Identifying potential insecure functionality  
- Understanding how very small weaknesses can lead to bigger attacks  

> All exercises were done legally in TryHackMe’s isolated environment.

## 🛠 Skills & Techniques Practiced

- Basic offensive security thinking  
- Understanding website behavior  
- Reconnaissance fundamentals  
- Taking structured notes during hacking exercises  

---

## 🧠 Relevance to SOC / Blue Team

Even though this is an **offensive** room, it is extremely valuable for **SOC Analysts**:

- Helps understand how attackers actually behave  
- Makes it easier to interpret web-attack alerts in SIEM  
- Builds intuition for detecting suspicious patterns  
- Helps in writing better detection use cases

## ✅ Summary

This room gave me my **first real experience** in ethical hacking.  
I learned how to think like an attacker, how to explore a website for weaknesses, and why understanding offensive techniques is essential—even for defensive roles like SOC.
