# Defensive Security Intro – TryHackMe

## 🧩 Room Overview
This room introduced me to **defensive security**, also known as **Blue Team** operations.  
While offensive security focuses on attacking, defensive security focuses on **protecting, detecting, and responding** to threats.

- Platform: **TryHackMe**
- Path: **Introduction / Beginner**
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Focus: Understanding core responsibilities of defenders and SOC teams

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand what defensive security is and how it differs from offensive security  
- Learn roles such as **SOC Analyst**, **Threat Hunter**, and **Incident Responder**  
- Explore fundamental defensive concepts like **logs**, **monitoring**, and **alerts**  
- Learn how defenders identify and respond to suspicious activity  

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. What is Defensive Security?
- Protecting systems from unauthorized access  
- Monitoring networks and logs for signs of attacks  
- Responding to incidents quickly to minimize damage  
- Implementing security controls and policies  

### 2. Roles in the Blue Team
**SOC Analyst (Tier 1 / Tier 2):**  
- Monitors SIEM alerts  
- Investigates suspicious events  
- Escalates real threats to incident responders  

**Threat Hunter:**  
- Proactively searches for undetected threats  
- Looks for abnormal patterns and attacker behavior  

**Incident Responder:**  
- Handles active security incidents  
- Contains attacks, removes malware, and restores systems  

### 3. Key Defensive Tools & Concepts
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**  
  Used to collect, analyze, and alert on security logs  
- **Logs** (Windows, Linux, firewall logs, web logs…)  
- **Alerting systems**  
- **Use cases / detection rules**  
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**  
- **Indicators of Attack (IOAs)**

## 🛡 How Defense Detects Attacks  
This room taught me how defenders spot malicious behavior such as:

- Repeated login failures  
- Strange IP addresses  
- Unusual file behavior  
- Suspicious PowerShell commands  
- Malware-like network patterns  
- Unauthorized privilege escalation  

---

## 🧪 Practical Outlook  
While this room did not use a hands-on lab, it prepared me for real SOC work by:

- Explaining how logs reveal attacker activity  
- Showing how SOC analysts analyze alerts  
- Demonstrating typical attack chains (kill chain)  
- Teaching how defenders think under pressure  

---

## 🧠 Relevance to My Future SOC Role
This room builds the foundation for becoming a SOC Analyst:

- Understanding job responsibilities  
- Knowing what alerts and logs matter  
- Learning how cyberattacks look from the defender’s perspective  
- Understanding how SIEMs help detect incidents  
- Getting introduced to the daily workflow of a SOC team  

---

## ✅ Summary

This room gave me a clear understanding of the defensive side of cybersecurity.  
I learned how SOC Analysts protect organizations, monitor for threats, and respond to incidents.  
It set the foundation for the **Google Cybersecurity / SOC Analyst** path I will focus on next.
