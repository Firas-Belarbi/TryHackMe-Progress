## 🧠 **What I Learned Today**

### 🔹 **Understanding SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**  
A **SIEM** is the core security system used inside a **SOC (Security Operations Center)**. It collects logs from multiple sources, normalizes the data, correlates events to detect suspicious activity, and generates alerts based on detection rules.

### 🔹 **Why SIEM Is Needed**
- Networks generate **huge volumes of logs** every second.
- Logs come from different devices: Windows, Linux, firewalls, servers…
- Logs have **different formats**.
- Without correlation, there is **no context**.
- Manual investigation is **impossible at scale**.
- SIEM solves these problems through:
  - Centralization  
  - Normalization  
  - Correlation  
  - Alerting  
  - Dashboards

## 🗂️ **Log Sources**

### **1. Host-Centric Logs**
Generated by:
- Windows  
- Linux  
- Servers  

Examples include:
- User authentication  
- Process execution  
- Registry changes  
- File access  
- PowerShell commands  

### **2. Network-Centric Logs**
Generated by:
- Firewalls  
- IDS/IPS  
- Routers  
- VPN gateways  

Examples include:
- SSH connections  
- FTP transfers  
- VPN logins  
- Website access  
- Shared folder access

## 🧩 **How SIEM Handles Logs**

### **Log Collection & Ingestion**
Common methods:
- **Agent / Forwarder** (like Splunk UF)  
- **Syslog**  
- **Manual Upload**  
- **Port-Forwarding**  

Typical log locations:
- Linux HTTP logs → `/var/log/httpd`  
- Cron logs → `/var/log/cron`  
- Authentication logs → `/var/log/auth.log`  

### **Normalization & Parsing**
Raw logs → Extract fields → Convert to **one unified format**.

### **Correlation Engine**
The SIEM links events from different sources to detect malicious patterns.  

**Example Attack Flow:**
1. Haris logs in from unusual VPN IP  
2. Accesses shared files  
3. Runs PowerShell  
4. The machine connects to an external IP  
→ Correlated: **Possible data exfiltration**  

### **Dashboards**
SIEM dashboards provide snapshots of:
- Top alerts  
- Failed logins  
- Event volume  
- Triggered rules  

---

## ⚙️ **Detection Rules**

### **How Rules Work**
Rules are logical expressions that trigger alerts when conditions are met.

Examples:
- **5 failed logins in 10 sec** → Brute-force alert  
- **Outbound traffic > 25MB** → Data exfiltration alert  
- **Event ID 104** → Log clearing  
- **4688 + whoami** → Suspicious process execution  

### **Example Rule Used in TryHackMe Lab**
If EventID = 4688 AND Log_Source = WindowsEventLogs AND ProcessName = (miner OR crypt)
Then Trigger "Potential CryptoMiner Activity"

---

## 🔍 **Alert Investigation Process**

Steps followed by a SOC analyst:
1. Examine triggered events  
2. Check the rule logic  
3. Decide if the alert is:
   - **True Positive (TP)**  
   - **False Positive (FP)**
4. Take appropriate action:
   - Adjust rule (FP)  
   - Investigate further (TP)  
   - Isolate host  
   - Block IP  
   - Notify asset owner

# 🧪 **What I Practiced Today — Step-by-Step**

### ✅ **Step 1 — Started Suspicious Activity**
Pressed **Start Suspicious Activity** → SIEM dashboard generated a new alert.

### ✅ **Step 2 — Identified the Malicious Process**
The executable responsible for the alert was:

**`cudominer.exe`**

### ✅ **Step 3 — Investigated the Event**
- Event ID: **4688**  
- Username: **chris**  
- Hostname: **HR_02**  

### ✅ **Step 4 — Verified Rule Logic**
Rule triggered because:
- It searches for **process names containing “miner”**
- **cudominer.exe** includes the keyword  

### ✅ **Step 5 — Classified the Alert**
This was a **True Positive**:
- HR employee running mining software  
- Suspicious filename  
- Located in a temp directory  
- Matches rule conditions  

### ✅ **Step 6 — Retrieved the Flag**
After choosing the correct action, I obtained:

**THM{000_SIEM_INTRO}**

# 🎯 **Final Summary**

Today’s session improved my understanding of:
- SIEM architecture  
- Log ingestion  
- Normalization  
- Event correlation  
- Detection rules  
- Investigating alerts  
- Identifying True/False Positives  

I also applied these concepts practically by detecting and investigating a **crypto-miner execution** on an HR machine using the SIEM interface.

This was a solid step in building real SOC analyst skills.
