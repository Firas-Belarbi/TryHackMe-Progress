## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Learn how to use advanced Google search operators  
- Understand how to filter and refine online information  
- Gain basic OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) awareness  
- Improve speed and accuracy when doing research during investigations

## 🔑 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. What is OSINT?
- Gathering intelligence from **publicly available information**  
- Used in cybersecurity, penetration testing, investigations, digital forensics, etc.  
- Helps analysts understand potential threats or attacker behavior  

### 2. Google Search Operators
Learned how to use operators to refine search results:

| Operator | Function | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `""` | Search exact phrase | `"error code 0x0000001"` |
| `site:` | Search inside one domain | `site:microsoft.com windows logs` |
| `filetype:` | Find specific file formats | `filetype:pdf incident response` |
| `intitle:` | Words inside page titles | `intitle:"login page"` |
| `-` | Exclude keywords | `phishing -email` |
| `OR` | Combine conditions | `linux OR ubuntu logs` |

These operators are extremely useful when analyzing alerts or researching malware.

## 🔍 Why Search Skills Matter in Cybersecurity

### For SOC Analysts:
- Quickly investigate alerts  
- Look up IOCs, suspicious domains, hash values  
- Understand vulnerabilities (CVE search)  
- Research logs or error patterns  

### For Pentesters:
- Discover hidden information  
- Perform recon on targets  
- Find exposed PDF/DOC files  
- Locate forgotten directories or subdomains

## 🧪 Practical Learning

Tasks in this room included:

- Finding specific information using exact phrases  
- Using `site:` to search within a specific domain  
- Searching for exposed documents using `filetype:`  
- Eliminating unwanted results using the `-` operator  
- Using OR logic to broaden or refine queries  

This builds real-world investigation and research skills.
